# Getting Started
Nightbird serves as an Angular 2 and Typescript boilerplate which will help you to start new projects fast.

## Values
There are plenty of boilerplates out there. Why create another one? Well, because our team shares certain values that we can't find in just one boilerplate. So, we are taking the BEST ideas from all the boilerplates we have seen and mixing them with our values. Here are some of the values our team shares:

* Developer experience must be friction-free.
* Developers must have quick feedback when changes are made.
* Developers need the freedom to choose css framework.
* Tests are more than coverage, they guide design.
* Refactoring code should be painless.

## Installation
-Open your terminal and run the following command:

  ```$ npm install â€“g  yo generator-nightbird```

-Create a new folder for your project and navigate to that folder.
Then, run the following command:
	
```$ yo nightbird```

## Running Nightbird
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. type `gulp` in your terminal to start a local server which will watch, build (in-memory), run specs, and open a new browser tab for you.
```
#Develoment
gulp

#Production
gulp prod
```
